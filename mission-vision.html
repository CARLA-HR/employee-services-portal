<h1>HMR GROUP OF COMPANIES</h1>
<p>
The HMR venture began in the Philippines on August 4, 1992 as Harrington Metal Recyclers. In October , 1992 the name was changed to HMR Philippines, Inc. which is widely known as “Your Best Surplus Haus.”  With HMR’s continuing growth and expansion, the business has diversified  into ten different business units, each of  which has  it’s  own core competencies such  as the main distributor of products,  wholesale/retail store,  environmental compliance, auctions,  manufacturing,  and telephone and networking solutions. The business units are as follows:

HMR  PHILS ( HQ/SSU) –serves as the Shared Services Unit
HMR PHILS (CENTRAL WAREHOUSE) -  Main central distribution warehouse of products to 
                           affiliates, Qualified  wholesalers and franchise stores
HMR PHILS (PROJECT/ LOGISTICS – provides trucking and manpower for pull outs for all 
                         affiliates as  well as services  to other companies outside the group
HMR Philippines, Inc.  Retail branches (Pioneer, Sta. Rosa,  Festival, Jaka)
HMR Envirocycle Full Service electronic and mechanical de-manufacturing and 
recycling operations - environmental compliance, scrap disposal solutions

                       services

From its start in metal recovery and recycling, HMR has since broadened its scope to become a Full Service Asset Management Company. “Full Service” means that we work with our clients to assure that their redundant assets are remarketed, recycled or de-manufactured in the most efficient and environmentally responsible way, while conforming to the HMR Product Stewardship Policy.

The key to Full Service Asset Management is integration of each business unit’s core competencies, (comprehensive asset management, environmental responsibility and maximum financial returns) from sourcing, refurbishing, wholesaling, retailing and environmental de-manufacturing services. We act as a single source, with the support of key partners. 

Among the products of the group are computers and peripherals, home and office furniture, audio/video equipment, telecommunications equipment, medical and industrial equipment, toys and novelty items, hardware, electronics and the list goes on. New types of products are added on a regular basis, as we search for bargains both domestically and internationally, offering our customers a unique shopping experience  

With its continuous growth and success, HMR believes that its greatest assets are its employees. Every employee is important to the organization and makes a unique contribution to the whole corporate effort. HMR is determined to develop, train and assist its employees in meeting the challenges of their jobs and in assuming more responsible positions in the future.
